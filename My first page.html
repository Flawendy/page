        <h3>My life</h3>
        <p>Since my 4, I lost my mom and I have been growing up as a<em>street boy</em>.Fortunately I had and I still have a good dad.</p>
        <p>I used to be in the obligation to push myself forward and to become somebody, it's the reason I did my best at the clasic school</p>
        <p>But I was not able to chase my dream in these circumstances so I choose to leave my home, my confort zone to become somebody</p>
        <p>Now I am learning computer science and I am proud to say I am a<strong>Web Developer</strong></p>
        <h3>My Hope</h3>
        <p>I am hoping to become a great developer and to be able to help my family and my country</p>
